				<p class='about-content'>Hello, I'm Michael. I am a Full Stack Web Developer from North Carolina based in New York City. I use Ruby and JavaScript languages. I create applications that are responsive, user friendly, clean, fun, and innovative. Ruby on Rails and Sinatra are my main specialties when creating web applications. The syntax is very clean and understandable. I am very eager to learn something new all the time so whenever a new technology comes out, I do whatever it takes to master the skill. When it comes to code, I do whatever it takes to find the right syntax and continue building until it becomes a 100% working app.</p>
				<br>
				<p class='about-content'>I graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program which took place in New York City for 12 weeks. During the course, I experienced lots of frustration, and stress from learning code and applying them into web applications. General Assembly has gave me the mentality of a working as a Web Developer in the real world and I'm very grateful for that experience. General Assembly had opened up a whole new world for me. My classmates and I have grown so close to each other and consider ourselves family. I never knew how much I love eating bagels in the mornings and drinking hard apple cider during Happy Hour.
				While I'm not coding, I love watching YouTube, Google, eating out, exploring NYC, and having fun with my former classmates. I love travel and my dream is a roadtrip to visit every diner, dives, and drive-ins in the USA.</p>
